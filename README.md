# Arbitrary-Integer-Adder
A C program which lets you add arbitrarily large integers by using linked lists.

The user inout is expected to be an integer. Each digit is made to be a nod of a linked list freeing us from the chackles of register size and allow us to play with really large numbers. 

All interaction happens via terminal. Little to no faulty input protection in the code, so use it correctly ;)
